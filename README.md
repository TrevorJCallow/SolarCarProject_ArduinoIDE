SolarCar Project
This code was part of the ASU FSE100 class. This is the complete running of the DC motor and control through the sensors. This was run by having a light sensor detect green or no color and 
then when red made it past the threshold the car would stop and wait for green to continue. Full autonomous. Turning was added through a seperate code which will be added once i find the file.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST!
